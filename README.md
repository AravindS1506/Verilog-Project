# Verilog-Project
This is a basic project to explore various digital circuits on Verilog.
Additionally, a basic traffic light controller was designed.

The traffic light control has 2 lights, highway and farm. A total of four modes: 1) Highway green, farm red 2)Highway yellow, farm red 3)Highway red, farm green 4) Highway red, farm yellow
Assuming the farm has much less traffic compared to the highway, the default mode can be green for highway and red for farm.
